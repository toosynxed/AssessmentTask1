Assessment Task 1 for Software Engineering:

Hey There!

Thanks for downloading my game!

Before you get started, just a few things to note:

  1. You will want to install the "main_v3" branch, not the "main" branch.
  2. All relevant files can be found under the folder, "Packet_Eamon_Wong".
  4. To play the text-based game, you want to select the file called, "commandline.py" under the "Command Line" folder.
  5. To play the GUI-based game, you want to select the file called, "GUI_V2.py", NOTE: V2, not just "GUI.py".
  6. For Windows users, colour and spacing will not be the same as MacBook visuals, just keep that in mind.


Download Instructions:

  1. Make sure that you are viewing the branch, "main_v3"
  2. At the top right corner, there is a green button with text, "<> Code"
  3. Click on it, and in the dropdown menu, select, "Download ZIP"
  4. Once the file is done downloading, extract it
  5. Open your prefered coding platform, and create a new window
  6. Drag-and-drop the extracted ZIP file onto the window
  7. Select the folder, "Packet_Eamon_Wong"
  8. For GUI game, select the folder, "GUI", and file, "GUI_V2.py"
  9. For text-based game, select the folder, "Command Line", and file, "commandline.py"
  10. Enjoy!


Thanks for downloading!
