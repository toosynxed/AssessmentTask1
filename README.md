Assessment Task 1 for Software Engineering:

Hey There!

Thanks for downloading my game!

Before you get started, just a few things to note:
  1. You will want to install the "main_v3" branch, not the "main" branch.
  2. To play the text-based game, you want to select the file called, "commandline.py" under the "CommandLine" folder.
  3. To play the GUI-based game, you want to select the file called, "GUI_V2.py", NOTE: V2, not just "GUI.py".
  4. For Windows users, colour and spacing will not be the same as MacBook visuals, just keep that in mind.

Thanks for downloading!
